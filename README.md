# CS336 Project
This project demonstrates a simulated Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. This simulation sends HTTP protocol to an (fake) IP address; ultimately, this project documents the traffic flow and shows the results of a DDoS attack. This is merely for educational/testing purposes only.

## Tools to use:
Goldeneye
Raspberry Pi (with Kali Linux)

# Computer Networks Project
This project demonstrates a simulated Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. This simulation sends protocol to an (fake) IP address or network, and floods it with packets; ultimately, this project documents the traffic flow and shows the results and (potential) effects of a DDoS attack. This is merely for educational/testing purposes only.

## Goal:
Although websites are more or less secured nowadays, this simple python script seeks to send protocol packets to a server. If successful, the targetted website/server would be down   

## Tools to use:
Etherape  
Raspberry Pi (with Kali Linux)   
https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ 


## Usage:   
python simddos.py -s [IP/Domain]


## Disclaimer:
Again, this is merely for educational/testing purposes only. Pleae use responsibly.

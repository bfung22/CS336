# Computer Networks Project
This project demonstrates a simulated Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. This simulation sends protocol to an (fake) IP address or network, and floods it with packets; ultimately, this project documents the traffic flow and shows the results and (potential) effects of a DDoS attack. This is merely for educational/testing purposes only.

## Tools to use:
Goldeneye  
Etherape  
Raspberry Pi (with Kali Linux)

## Installation:
